### Sublime Text
Redefined the way we look at text editors, and what they should be able to do. Sadly lost it's mojo a couple of years ago. Slow development.  
[👁‍🗨 download](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

### Windows Terminal
Finally a nice terminal for Windows! Even steer your [WSL](#wsl). Together with its SH functionality (install via "Optional Features") it also replaced _putty_ for me.
Did you know you can start the new Terminal by typing in "wt" in the adress bar of the Explorer? (Same for "cmd" and "wsl")    
[👁‍🗨 download](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)

### WSL
Windows Subsystem for Linux. What a great thing – finally use `makefile`s and other nifty Linux stuff. At the moment Ubuntu on WSL1 is running for me well.  
[👁‍🗨 download](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/wsl/install-win10)

### Vuescan
Best scanning solution out there. Can be calibrated with an [IT8 target](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT8#/media/File:IT8_color_target_by_EGM_Laboratories.jpg)!  
[👁‍🗨 download](https://www.hamrick.com/)

### Notion
Best notekeeping tool. Used as a small Wiki for me. Not fond of the way they abstracted the files away, tho. I also tried [_Roam_](https://roamresearch.com/) and liked the idea, but it's much overpriced and I don't want my data lying around on their servers. (Also they lost a lot of those data, so I wouldn't trust them at all.) Instead I'm using [VSCode](#vscode) with plugins to achieve the same, but offline on my own device.

### Cyberduck
FTP client. Not really great, but all FTP clients are shite.  
[👁‍🗨 download](https://cyberduck.io/)

### KeePass
Stores my passwords.

## UX Enhancing
### PowerToys
Filled with goodies! It does so much and boosted my productivity. Replaced many different utilities for me.
- color picker
- FanyZones
- image resizer (via context menu)
- keyboard manager
- PowerRename
- PT Run (like Mac's Spotlight)  
[👁‍🗨 download](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys)

### Quicklook
This gives Windows users the same quicklook feature as known from the Mac. (The only thing I'm missing in Win compared to Mac)  
[👁‍🗨 download](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook) [with all plugins installed]

### Everything
Actually finds _everything_ on your PC; can be fed with RegEx, too!  
[👁‍🗨 download](https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/)

### Bulk Rename Utility
Great software (even tho the UI is a bit _cluttered_), but I use it less since the advent of [PowerRename](#powertoys).  
[👁‍🗨 download](https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/)

### DisplayCAL
To calibrate your display, make dispay profiles, and autoload them. The profiles were done with an older [Color Munki Smile](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0055MBQOW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=beckeluc-21&camp=1638&creative=6742&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0055MBQOW&linkId=a091febdd6fbdecfe4f8c358589c024d).

### Backblaze
The easiest way to backup, and cheap compared to other solutions too. I like how once you've set it up you can just forget about it. I sleep better since I know every bit of data is secured and recoverable.  
[👁‍🗨 download](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/02fga9)

### DisplayFusion Pro
Invaluable when dealing with multiple monitors. Great to have for the "Multi-taskbar with programs pinned on the right one"-thing alone.  
[👁‍🗨 download](https://www.displayfusion.com/)

### Twinkle Tray
Does one thing and does it well: Set the display brightness per monitor.
